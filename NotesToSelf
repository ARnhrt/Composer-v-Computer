This will be the third go of this experiment. During the second, all my research from the first was significantly outdated despite only being a few months old. I can only assume the same applies here.
Things to do differently:
- Study up on music theory. If you won't rope some poor music major into helping, you might as well know what you're talking about.
- Double check copyright and terms of service for AI generators. It would be swell to avoid a lawsuit. 
- Conduct a blind survey to loosely rank outputs. The bones of this are in the GitHub already.
- Write a better RNG program with adjustments for style/mood
  - Document well, especially include the limitations of the program
