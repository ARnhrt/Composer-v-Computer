# Notes and Observations
*Informal notes from various points in the study*
## AIVA (v5.2.0)
Created by Aiva Technologies, funded by
- Kima Ventures
- The Luxembourg Ministry of Finance

#### Pricing:
- Free with account
- Upgrades available
- 3 downloads monthly (with free plan)
- Unlimited tracks generated

#### Influences:
- Can upload "influences" to generate tracks
  - Can also choose an emotion to make new tracks
    - These are the options they give for emotions: ðŸ˜Œ ðŸ¥³ ðŸ˜­ ðŸ˜¬
      - *This is exactly what is on the website, I'm not trying to be funny, this is real.*
    - First attempt: I picked ðŸ˜¬, which seems to be creep/suspenseful. Tracks used roughly the same instruments as the influence (an RNG track from a previous project). Changed the key signature from G Major to its relative minor E. 
    - Second attempt: I did not select an emotion but it gave me a creepy sounding song anyway. Instrumentation was also off-- it added strings for some reason.
- So far, the tracks at least sound alright. No dissonance or feedback sounds.

#### Notes from the trials:
- Running samples from the [folk] section, I've been very surprised by the results so far. 


## MusicFX

#### Quality:
- Surprisingly, the quality seems to have decreased since the original tests in November.
- Occasionally creates uncanny, dissonant, or screeching sounds.
  - Output for "50s Doo-wop music" was so unpleasent that the category was removed from the study.
