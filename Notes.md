# Notes and Observations
*Informal notes from various points in the study*
## AIVA (v5.2.0)
Created by Aiva Technologies, funded by
- Kima Ventures
- The Luxembourg Ministry of Finance

#### Pricing:
- Free with account
- Upgrades available
- 3 downloads monthly (with free plan)
- Unlimited tracks generated

#### Influences:
- Can upload "influences" to generate tracks
  - Can also choose an emotion to make new tracks
    - These are the options they give for emotions: ðŸ˜Œ ðŸ¥³ ðŸ˜­ ðŸ˜¬
      - *This is exactly what is on the website, I'm not trying to be funny, this is real.*
    - Testing Round: I picked ðŸ˜¬, which seems to be creepy/suspenseful. Tracks used roughly the same instruments as the influence (an RNG track from a previous project). Changed the key signature from G Major to its relative minor E. 
- So far, the tracks at least sound alright. No dissonance or feedback sounds.

#### Notes from the trials:
- Running samples from the [folk] section, I've been very surprised by the results so far.
  - Despite the influence using woodwinds and guitar, the output from AIVA has and electric piano lead and cello backing.
- I am 9 generations into the [8-bit] trials and there is no end in site.

#### Quality:
- Surprisingly, the quality seems to have decreased since the original tests in November.
- Occasionally creates uncanny, dissonant, or screeching sounds.
  - Output for "50s Doo-wop music" was so unpleasent that the category was removed from the study.
- Prompts aren't matching the output, but that may be because of me.
