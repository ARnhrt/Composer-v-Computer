#### Influences:
- Can upload "influences" to generate tracks
  - Can also choose an emotion to make new tracks
    - These are the options they give for emotions: ðŸ˜Œ ðŸ¥³ ðŸ˜­ ðŸ˜¬
      - *This is exactly what is on the website, I'm not trying to be funny, this is real.*
    - First attempt: I picked ðŸ˜¬, which seems to be scary. Tracks used roughly the same instruments as the influence (an RNG track from a previous project). Key signature was changed to E Minor (the influence's was G Major, the relative major of E Minor). 
    - Second attempt: I did not select an emotion but it gave me a creepy sounding song anyway. Instrumentation was also off-- it added strings for some reason.
- So far, the tracks at least sound alright. No dissonance or feedback sounds.
